Project 3 TaskList ReadMe


As a team, we started by making a product backlog. We quickly abandoned the product backlog as a team (and Jorrie as pm) and instead focused on using individual sprint lists. In the future, the pm will essentially own the product backlog and play administrator to the sprint lists. The early workings of this shift in paradigm is visible in our task administration process. Weâ€™ve included the old version of the sprint log below the more current to illustrate our shift in schedule and scope.
